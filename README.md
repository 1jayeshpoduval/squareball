This is an interactive animation project featuring a green square that moves in response to arrow key clicks. Built with Framer Motion, this was my first experiment with the library, and it showcases smooth spring animations. While this is just the initial version, there are plans for further enhancements.

Features -

Directional Movement: Click the up, down, left, or right arrows to move the green square accordingly.
Smooth Animations: Utilizes Framer Motion's spring animation for fluid movement.

Future Enhancements -
Bounding Box: Prevent the square from moving out of the designated area, even when the arrow keys are clicked repeatedly.
